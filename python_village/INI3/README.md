Strings and Lists
=================


Problem
-------

**Given:** A string *s* of length at most 200 letters and four integers *a*, *b*, *c* and *d*.

**Return:** The slice of this string from indices *a* through *b* and *c* through *d* (with space in between), *inclusively*. 
In other words, we should include elements *s[b]* and *s[d]* in our slice.
